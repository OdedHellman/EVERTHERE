# Web Crawler #
## Overview  ##
This crawler aims to take a CSV file containing organizations' domains and create a new CSV file that includes a list of partners domain for each organization.
 
## Running the Crawler ##
 
The web crawler gets from the user one arguments:
An input CSV file containes:
* Organization Name - The name of the organization that the crawler will crawl.
* Website - The domain of 'Organization Name.'

An example of an input file called 'Input.csv' locates at this repo).
 

 
 
## Output ##

The crawler outputs a CSV file that contains two columns:
 
* Organization Web Page - The domain of the website that has been crawled.
* Partners Web Page - domains of the partner's companies of the appropriate organization.
 
The output file will be generated/saved in the same directory the app running at.
